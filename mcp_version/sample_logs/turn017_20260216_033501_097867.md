## LLM Description

**Sample 1960s Psychedelic Poster Art Content**
- Image 1: Abstract expressionist chaotic composition with pink/beige brushstrokes, Picasso-esque distorted figures, graffiti-like marks, high energy fragmentation
- Image 2: Bright neon Vegas/Hollywood illusion with kaleidoscopic signage, washed-out retro coloring, dense urban visual overload
- Image 3: Mixed blue-red curvilinear abstract forms, earthy ochre wash, sumi-e ink influence with western pop colors
- Image 4: Sunset Boulevard pop art collage, movie billboards (Some Like It Hot, Jaws, Casablanca), deep blue sky, neon casino aesthetic
- Image 5: Purple field with stylized female figure in sunglasses, flowing hair, bell-bottoms with tie-dye pattern, retro-mod commercial illustration style

Most capture vintage psychedelic essence but some more pop art than overtly psychedelic.
