## LLM Description

Ethereal artwork samples show soft color field paintings with extreme blur and gentle color transitions - warm orange-pink gradients bleeding into luminous centers, teal-orange atmospheric blends, blue-purple fields with golden edges. The diffused light creates dreamlike, hazy atmospheres with no hard edges, emphasizing luminous softness.
