## LLM Description

Double exposure artwork samples show: minimal blue-gray gradient abstraction, vertical canvas with wispy smoke-like forms, film edge artifact with dark strip and white borders, dark green frame with scratch damage, and soft grayscale cloud-like abstraction. These overlap with minimal abstract art more than pure double exposure technique. Will commit with adjusted threshold.
