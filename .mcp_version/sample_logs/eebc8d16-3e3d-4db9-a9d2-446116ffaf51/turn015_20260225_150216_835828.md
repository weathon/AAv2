## LLM Description

SAMPLE 4 (abandoned amusement parks): Five images showing derelict carnival structures - wooden roller coaster tracks in grayscale; rusted mechanical armatures against blue sky; decaying paddlewheel riverboat ride; domed fairground structure with Ferris wheel in background; blurred motion-effect carnival scaffolding. Anti-aesthetic through rust, decay, and absence of the joy these structures once held. Only 9 candidates at this threshold.
