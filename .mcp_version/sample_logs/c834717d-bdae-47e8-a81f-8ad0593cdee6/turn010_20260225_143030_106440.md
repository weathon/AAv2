## LLM Description

Sampled 5 images from endless hallway/corridor query: (1) flooded institutional interior with white tiles and multiple dark doorways receding into purplish depth; (2) blue-tiled corridor with water reflections and overhead lights; (3) long corridor with green glass block windows and vanishing point glow; (4) white tiled hallway with water channel and fluorescent ceiling lights; (5) nested doorways creating rectangular perspective with moody lighting. All exhibit liminal, disorienting architectural spaces - perfect examples of anti-aesthetic spatial violations and endless depth without focal termination.
