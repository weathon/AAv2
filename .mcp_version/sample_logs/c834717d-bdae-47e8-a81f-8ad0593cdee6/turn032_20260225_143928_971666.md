## LLM Description

Sampled 'awkward framing' query returned mostly corrupted/blank images: empty gradients, black frames, white voids. Not identifying actual bad-framing scenarios with cut-off subjects. Need different query approach for purposeful obscured views - trying portrait/figure-specific terms with cropping at frame edges.
