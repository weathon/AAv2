[2026-02-15 00:03:35] Starting the curation for "Psychedelic art". 
Plan:
1. Broad search for "Psychedelic art" to see the baseline.
2. Decompose into:
   - "Fractal geometry and Mandalas" (High Aesthetic / Structured)
   - "Surreal melting faces and distorted bodies" (Surrealism / Form)
   - "Neon clashing colors and acid trip visuals" (Anti-aesthetic / Color chaos)
   - "Deep fried psychedelic glitches" (Low-fi / Anti-aesthetic)
   - "Dreamcore psychedelic liminal spaces" (Uncanny / Eerie)
3. Target >200 images across these sub-categories.
4. Monitor aesthetics scores to ensure representation of both traditional 'beauty' and 'intentional chaos'.
[2026-02-15 00:11:49] Plan for Psychedelic Art dataset construction:
1. Broad exploration of "Psychedelic Art" across 'artwork' and 'photos'.
2. Breakdown into sub-elements:
   - High-Aesthetic: "Fractal geometry", "Vibrant kaleidoscope patterns", "Fluorescent liquid marbling".
   - Anti-Aesthetic/Alternative: "Glitch psychedelic distortion", "Chaotic neon noise", "Disturbing hallucinatory dreamcore", "Oversaturated visual clash".
3. For each sub-element: Search, sample images, assess aesthetics (expecting low scores for the 'alternative' categories), and commit with specific messages.
4. Target: >200 images, covering a wide spectrum from polished digital art to raw, chaotic visual experiments.
[2026-02-15 00:23:20] Initial plan for 'Psychedelic Art' dataset curation. I will break this down into three main categories: 1. Traditional High-Aesthetics (vibrant colors, intricate fractals, professional digital art), 2. Dreamcore/Liminal (surreal, unsettling, low-fi psychedelic), and 3. Glitch/Anti-Aesthetics (distorted visuals, visual noise, clashing colors). 
Step 1: Broad search for 'psychedelic' to understand the baseline.
Step 2: Sub-element decomposition: Fractals, Melting textures, Neon high-contrast, Glitched feedback loops, Surreal dreamscapes.
Step 3: Systematic search, sampling, aesthetic rating, and committing.
[2026-02-15 00:23:26] The broad search for 'psychedelic art' in the 'artwork' dataset provided a good baseline. Now I will decompose this into specific sub-elements. First, targeting high-aesthetic 'Fractals and Sacred Geometry' to capture the structured, vibrant side of psychedelia.
[2026-02-15 00:23:31] Sampling 'Mandalas and Fractals' from the 'artwork' dataset to confirm the similarity threshold for a high-aesthetic commit. I'm aiming for a threshold of 0.4 based on the initial search. Following sample with aesthetic rating.
[2026-02-15 00:23:43] Committing 15 images of fractals, focusing on high-aesthetic value for the baseline of the 'psychedelic' theme. Subsequent commits will target more diverse 'anti-aesthetic' and 'dreamcore' elements. 
Aiming for a threshold of 0.4. This part is 'High-Aesthetic'. 
Next: Transitioning to 'Melting textures and distorted faces' in 'photos' to explore uncomfortable and surreal imagery.
[2026-02-15 00:23:47] Transitioning to 'Melting textures and distorted faces' for a more unsettling/anti-aesthetic take on psychedelia. This category explores more surreal and potentially 'uncomfortable' visual expressions. Using 'photos' for more grounded but distorted realism.
[2026-02-15 00:23:56] Sampling and rating 'Distorted Faces' in 'photos' to evaluate their aesthetic and anti-aesthetic potential. Lower aesthetic scores (around 4-6) are expected and desired here as they challenge standard beauty. Commit will follow. Then, targeting 'Glitch and Digital Noise'.
[2026-02-15 00:24:17] Aesthetic scores for 'Distorted Faces' show a wide range with significant low-aesthetic potential (scores as low as -10). This is exactly what we need for the wide-spectrum goal. I will commit these visuals as a part of the 'Anti-Aesthetic/Surreal' sub-element. 
Next: Searching for 'Glitch/Datamosh' as a form of electronic psychedelia in 'photos'.
[2026-02-15 00:24:22] Wow, the 'distorted faces' query was very productive. I now have a solid 'Anti-Aesthetic' core. Now I'll pursue 'Glitch Art and Datamoshing' visuals to add a digital-decay psychedelic element. Using 'dreamcore' to find these.
[2026-02-15 00:24:26] 'dreamcore' yielded no results for 'glitch art datamoshing'. I will try in 'photos' and 'artwork' instead. Expanding to 'VHS decay' and 'static' in 'photos' to capture that low-fi, glitched aesthetic. 
Next: Searching for 'VHS aesthetic glitched landscape'.
[2026-02-15 00:24:34] I will sample and evaluate the 'VHS aesthetic' from the 'photos' dataset. These should provide a middle-ground of aesthetic and technical decay. 
Following up with aesthetic rating and then commit. Aiming for a threshold of 0.38.
[2026-02-15 00:24:54] Very strong distribution of low-aesthetic scores (-10 to 6 range), perfect for our 'Anti-Aesthetic' and 'Pluralistic' goal. I'm committing these VHS distortions now. 
Next: Final element - 'Neon High-Exposure Acid trip' in 'artwork' to provide some high-energy, vibrant content. Then concluding.
[2026-02-15 00:24:58] Last step: Adding the 'Neon Acid Trip' high-energy art for the final touch on the 'Psychedelic' theme, ensuring we have a balance between technical decay and vibrant visual density. 
Searching in 'artwork'. Then finishing.
[2026-02-15 00:25:04] Evaluating the 'Acid Trip Illustration' aesthetic. After this, I'll be committing and providing a final status summary. Current dataset has a strong anti-aesthetic foundation. Final element to bridge the gap between high-contrast and raw art. 
Follow with aesthetic rating. Aiming for threshold 0.35.
[2026-02-15 00:25:25] The 'High-Contrast Neon/Acid Trip' results in 'artwork' show a healthy mix. Some scores are very high (10+), highlighting the 'traditional' aesthetic side of the theme, while others are lower (-2), which contributes to the 'raw energy' aspect. I'll commit this last batch with a threshold of 0.35. 
Final plan summary: 1. Fractals (High-Aesthetic), 2. Distorted Faces (Anti-Aesthetic), 3. VHS Glitch (Anti-Aesthetic/Decay), 4. Neon Acid Trip (Mixed Raw energy). Total images should be around 1000. 
Checking final status.
[2026-02-15 01:09:09] PLAN: Theme = Psychedelic art. Goals: curate wide-spectrum mix of polished visionary art and anti-aesthetic psychedelic variants (glitch, chaotic color clashes, motion-blur trails). Datasets: artwork (structured/illustration), dreamcore (surreal/uncanny), photos (light painting/long exposure). Sub-elements tentatively: 1) Kaleidoscopic mandalas (high-aesthetic). 2) Fractal geometry (high-aesthetic). 3) Visionary/entheogenic iconography (high-aesthetic). 4) Glitch psychedelia: RGB shift, datamosh, pixel-sorting (anti-aesthetic). 5) Eye-searing clashing palettes, chaotic collages (anti-aesthetic). 6) Light painting & long exposure neon trails (photo-based high-aesthetic/experimental). 7) Double exposure & prismatic lens flares (photo/art bridge). Workflow per sub-element: search -> sample in score band -> aesthetics_rate -> pick threshold -> commit with message tags. Use negatives only for watermark/large text/blank & to trim false positives. Start with a broad probe in each dataset to gauge availability, then proceed with sub-element 1 in artwork.
[2026-02-16 00:36:14] MCP server test run
[2026-02-16 00:41:44] MCP server test run
[2026-02-16 00:55:39] Starting the 'Psychedelic Art' dataset curation. My goal is to capture a wide spectrum of visual styles, from high-aesthetic digital fractals and classic 60s posters to raw, chaotic, and 'anti-aesthetic' trippy visuals (glitch, deep dream-like distortions, oversaturated clashing colors). 

Plan:
1. Broad Search: Get a baseline for 'Psychedelic art' in 'artwork' and 'dreamcore'.
2. Sub-element Decomposition: 
   - Traditional/High-Aesthetic: Fractal patterns, Mandala designs, 1960s concert posters (Peter Max style).
   - Modern/Digital: Neon vaporwave fusion, Iridescent liquid textures.
   - Anti-Aesthetic/Raw: Glitch art distortions, Clashing neon colors, Surreal/unsettling 'Dreamcore' entities, Over-processed DeepDream-style visuals.
3. Execution: Sequential search, sampling, aesthetic rating (for calibration), and committing for each sub-element.
4. Review: Check distributions.
[2026-02-16 01:35:07] Starting collection for 'Psychedelic Art'.
Plan:
1. Broad search for 'Psychedelic Art' across all datasets.
2. Deconstruct into sub-elements:
   - High Aesthetics/Modern: Fractal patterns, neon fluid art, kaleidoscopic geometry.
   - Anti-Aesthetic/Raw: Glitch psychedelic, visual noise, clashing neon colors, distorted faces, 'bad trip' imagery.
   - Conceptual: Surreal dreamscapes (dreamcore), optical illusions.
3. Target 200+ images by iterating through these sub-elements with appropriate thresholds and negative prompts (watermarks, text).
4. Monitor aesthetics scores to ensure wide-spectrum coverage.
[2026-02-16 01:35:17] Initial search in 'artwork' showed a mix of abstract and psychedelic styles. However, 'dreamcore' returned no images for the specific query. I'll broaden the search in 'photos' and 'dreamcore' using more specific visual keywords like 'glitch', 'neon', 'kaleidoscope', and 'distorted visuals'. Starting with high-aesthetic fractal and fluid art.
[2026-02-16 01:49:18] Plan for 'Psychedelic art' dataset curation: 
1. Initial broad search to identify core aesthetics in 'artwork' and 'dreamcore'.
2. Deconstruct into sub-elements: 
   - High Aesthetics/Intricate: 'Fractal patterns', 'Vibrant mandalas', 'Fluid neon colors', 'Surreal visionary art'.
   - Anti-Aesthetics/Disorienting: 'Glitchy hallucinations', 'Distorted faces', 'Clashing high-contrast patterns', 'Nauseating optical illusions'.
3. Execute search, sample, and aesthetic rating for each sub-element.
4. Aim for >200 images, balancing technical perfection with raw/unsettling expressions.
[2026-02-16 01:51:48] Committed first batch of 48 images from 'artwork' focusing on geometric psychedelic patterns. Next: Dive into 'dreamcore' for more unsettling, anti-aesthetic psychedelic visuals.
[2026-02-16 02:00:33] The test image features a young girl with a subtle, knowing smile looking at the camera while a house burns in the background. 

Plan for 'Psychedelic Art' Dataset Curation:
1. Broad Exploration: Search 'psychedelic art' across 'artwork' and 'dreamcore' datasets to establish a baseline.
2. Decomposition into Sub-elements:
   - High Aesthetics/Conventional: 'fractal patterns', 'neon vibrant colors', 'surreal digital landscape', 'kaleidoscope patterns'.
   - Anti-Aesthetic/Raw: 'glitch art distortion', 'over-saturated clashing colors', 'disturbing dreamcore surrealism', 'blurry hallucinogenic visuals', 'messy hand-drawn psychedelic sketches'.
3. Iterative Commit: For each sub-element, perform search -> sample/aesthetics_rate -> commit (threshold > 0.35 typical).
4. Goal: Collect 200+ images covering both visually pleasing geometry and unsettling, raw sensory overload.
[2026-02-16 02:00:59] The first search returned a good mix of organized patterns and chaotic abstract works. 
Refining plan:
- Broadly commit decorative/high-aesthetic psychedelic art first to ensure coverage.
- Then specifically target the 'anti-aesthetic' side: clashing colors, technical degradation, and unsettling hallucinations.
Sub-element 1: Intricate/Decorative (Artwork)
Sub-element 2: Chaotic/Aggressive (Artwork)
Sub-element 3: Surreal/Distorting (Dreamcore)
Sub-element 4: Neon/Light trails (Photos)
Starting with Sub-element 1.
[2026-02-16 02:12:28] Plan: Build a wide-spectrum psychedelic art dataset. 
1. General search for 'Psychedelic art' across 'artwork' and 'dreamcore' to understand the baseline.
2. Deconstruct into sub-elements:
   - High Aesthetics/Traditional: Fractal patterns, vibrant neon mandalas, surreal oil paintings, visionary art.
   - Anti-Aesthetics/Raw/Distorted: Glitchy visuals, sensory overload (clashing colors), melted textures, unsettling/dark psychedelia, 'bad trip' imagery.
3. Use 'photos' for light painting and long exposure effects.
4. Filter out text and watermarks using negative prompts.
5. Aim for 200+ images with a mix of aesthetic scores.
[2026-02-16 02:21:55] Plan for Psychedelic Art: 1. Explore general concepts in 'artwork' and 'dreamcore' datasets. 2. Decompose into sub-elements: 'trippy fractal patterns', 'vibrant neon colors', 'surreal digital melting', 'kaleidoscopic symmetry', and 'glitch/lo-fi distortions'. 3. Apply both high-aesthetic (intricate) and anti-aesthetic (chaotic, low-res style) samples. 4. Target >200 images.
[2026-02-16 02:22:13] The sample contains abstract expressionist paintings with chaotic brushwork, vibrant graphic patterns in grid layouts, and surreal collages with high-contrast organic shapes. Colors range from earthy, muddy tones to bright, saturated primaries.
[2026-02-16 02:25:18] The images show night-time long exposure photography featuring light trails from cars on highways, blurry city skylines with bokeh effects, and colorful neon amusement park rides with motion blur. The colors are predominantly dark blacks contrasted with streaks of white, red, yellow, and green.
[2026-02-16 02:27:29] The images display radial kaleidoscopic patterns with folk-art influences, geometric symmetry, and intricate, hand-drawn floral and abstract motifs. Colors are varied, including both vibrant primaries and soft, muted pastels.
[2026-02-16 02:30:43] The sampled images feature highly abstract and distorted visuals, including circular motion blur in vibrant greens and reds, iridescent liquid textures, and macro shots of colorful drops on a metal grid. The overall feel is one of technical artifacts and sensory intensity.
[2026-02-16 02:57:51] Starting curation for 'Psychedelic Art'. Plan: 1. Explore broad concepts (swirls, neon, fractal). 2. Decompose into sub-elements: 'Fractal patterns', 'Neon fluid liquid', 'Trippy distorted faces', 'Hallucinatory landscape'. 3. Target both high-aesthetic (intricate, colorful) and anti-aesthetic (jarring contrasts, glitchy/low-res feel). 4. Use datasets: artwork, dreamcore, and photos.
[2026-02-16 02:58:16] The sampled images show abstract paintings with circular swirls, concentric squares, teal textured backgrounds with a single blue orb, and chaotic layered scribbles in purple and green. The composition ranges from clean geometric lines to messy, expressive brushwork.
[2026-02-16 03:26:43] **Psychedelic Art Curator Plan**

**Dataset Overview**: Psychedelic art is a perfect candidate for wide-spectrum aesthetics—encompassing both meticulously crafted visionary art and chaotic, perception-altering visuals. This spans from 1960s concert poster art to modern digital fractals, from spiritual mandalas to raw glitch aesthetics.

**Decomposition Strategy**:
1. **Fractals & Sacred Geometry** - recursive patterns, mathematical beauty
2. **Neon & Rainbow Palettes** - vibrant, clashing, unconventional color use
3. **Optical Illusions** - moiré, tunnels, spirals, warping perception
4. **Liquid/Melting Effects** - fluid distortion, surreal transformations
5. **Kaleidoscope Symmetry** - mandala patterns, radial designs
6. **Psychedelic Poster Art** - 60s/70s counter-culture aesthetic
7. **Visionary/Surreal Scenes** - dreamlike, hallucinatory imagery
8. **Blacklight/UV Art** - glow effects, reactive colors

**Dataset Focus**: Primarily `artwork` for traditional psychedelic art, `dreamcore` for surreal/distorted aesthetics, and `photos` for blacklight/concert photography.

**Starting with**: Initial broad search to establish baseline, then systematically explore each sub-element.
[2026-02-16 03:27:11] **Initial Search Results Analysis**
- Artwork dataset: Strong hits on 60s/70s concert poster art style - wavy lines, mandalas, bold primaries, spirals
- Photos dataset: Excellent capturing of swirling liquid patterns, blacklight effects, chromatic aberrations, tie-dye
- No dreamcore results for broad 'psychedelic art' - will need targeted queries

**Next Step**: Begin sub-element decomposition. Starting with fractals and sacred geometry as they bridge traditional and digital psychedelic aesthetics.
[2026-02-16 03:28:08] **Fractal Search Results**
- Artwork: Mandala-style sacred geometry, hand-colored intricate patterns, some with Indian/Asian spiritual influences
- Photos: Digital fractals, rainbow kaleidoscope patterns, recursive mathematical structures, neon symmetry, some with "fractalchallenge.com" watermarks (acceptable)
- Dreamcore: No results - will need different query strategy

**Visible Patterns**: Metallic rainbow textures, radial symmetry, Sierpinski-like structures, Julia/Mandelbrot-style spirals, light refraction patterns

**Next**: Sample from fractal queries to determine similarity thresholds for commit.
[2026-02-16 03:29:13] **Sampled Images Content (Photos Dataset)**
- Image 1: Peacock with feathers spread showing eye-pattern symmetry in natural fractal arrangement, iridescent blue-green-yellow coloration
- Image 2: Black and white water vortex/swirlpool creating spiral funnel pattern, high contrast monochromatic
- Image 3: Colorful light refraction/prism effect with pink, green, purple gradient blur
- Image 4: Abstract stacked sculptural form with faces/heads in totem-like arrangement, white on dark gray
- Image 5: Psychedelic lion/face statue overlaid with rainbow star patterns and chromatic distortion effects
[2026-02-16 03:30:08] **Sampled Images Content (Artwork Dataset)**
- Image 1: Abstract Miro-style painting with anthropomorphic figures, primary colors (red, blue, yellow, black), splatter technique
- Image 2: Two concentric square patterns (op art style) with rainbow gradient color progression from center outward
- Image 3: Circular floral/radial design with layered blue-green petals and yellow center on blue field
- Image 4: Geometric grid of four squares with diagonal striped patterns in yellow, pink, blue, creating optical illusion
- Image 5: Blueprint-style geometric drawing with two vertical totem-like structures featuring red and blue circles, network of fine lines

**Observation**: Artwork samples lean more toward op art and geometric abstraction than traditional psychedelic art; similarity threshold should be calibrated carefully.
[2026-02-16 03:31:42] **Aesthetics Analysis**
- Photos fractal query: Range -10.29 to 13.67, histogram peaks at 6-8 range (positive traditional aesthetic). One very low outlier at -10.29 suggests some genuinely challenging/repulsive content which serves the anti-aesthetic goal.
- Artwork fractal query: Range -2.68 to 11.58, bimodal distribution with some low-scores (-2.68, -1.39) and many high scores (8-11 range).

Both show good diversity in aesthetic scores - some receive low marks (anti-aesthetic success) and some high (traditional beauty). This aligns with wide-spectrum goals.
**Decision**: Commit both queries with threshold ~0.30 to include substantial volume while maintaining relevance.
[2026-02-16 03:32:18] **Commits Complete**
- Photos fractal: 638 images (532a58b6)
- Artwork sacred geometry: 131 images (c6fb0b9f)

**Total so far**: 769 images

**Next Phase**: Exploring 1960s-70s counterculture poster art, liquid/marble patterns, and neon/blacklight aesthetics. These will add historical context and counter-cultural legitimacy to the dataset.
[2026-02-16 03:33:43] **60s Psychedelic Poster Searches**
Three related queries all showing excellent results:
- Classic Fillmore poster style with wavy rainbow lines and bold primary colors
- Matisse-like "Tree of Life" 4-panel color grid designs
- Warhol-style repeated portraits (Marilyn, political figures) in color grids
- Neon linear optical effects and purple/gold flame motifs
- Bold black outlines, saturated primaries, counterculture aesthetic

Some less relevant: Minimalist color field paintings (Carmen Herrera style), abstract gradients

Next: Sample to calibrate thresholds for vintage psychedelic poster commit.
[2026-02-16 03:35:13] **Sample 1960s Psychedelic Poster Art Content**
- Image 1: Abstract expressionist chaotic composition with pink/beige brushstrokes, Picasso-esque distorted figures, graffiti-like marks, high energy fragmentation
- Image 2: Bright neon Vegas/Hollywood illusion with kaleidoscopic signage, washed-out retro coloring, dense urban visual overload
- Image 3: Mixed blue-red curvilinear abstract forms, earthy ochre wash, sumi-e ink influence with western pop colors
- Image 4: Sunset Boulevard pop art collage, movie billboards (Some Like It Hot, Jaws, Casablanca), deep blue sky, neon casino aesthetic
- Image 5: Purple field with stylized female figure in sunglasses, flowing hair, bell-bottoms with tie-dye pattern, retro-mod commercial illustration style

Most capture vintage psychedelic essence but some more pop art than overtly psychedelic.
[2026-02-16 04:09:17] Plan: Build a Psychedelic Art dataset covering both high-aesthetic (intricate, vibrant, balanced) and anti-aesthetic (glitchy, jarring colors, distorted, messy) spectrums. 
Sub-elements to explore:
1. High Aesthetic: Fractal patterns, Sacred geometry, Vibrant oil flow, Ethereal nebula.
2. Anti-Aesthetic/Raw: Glitch art, High contrast neon clash, Distorted faces, Low-fidelity trippy textures.
Datasets: 'artwork', 'dreamcore', 'photos'.
Target: ~200+ images.
[2026-02-16 04:09:31] Sampled images show geometric nested squares, colorful floral mandalas with stylized faces, abstract swirling patterns in primary colors, and a dusty pink diamond-shaped composition. Low density but high relevance to geometric psychedelic sub-element.
[2026-02-16 04:12:34] Sampled images feature macro textures like cracked surfaces with a red/green glow, white light swirls, vertical fiber-like textures, glowing pink droplets on a dark surface, and blurry blue water ripples. Large candidate pool available for light-based experimental art.
[2026-02-16 04:14:40] Sampled abstract works show varied styles: a vibrant hilly landscape with a red sky, textured impressionistic forest, dark purple/maroon color field, bright yellow textured abstract, and minimalist diagonal rainbow stripes. Good diversity for the chaotic/clashing sub-element.

[2026-02-16 17:38:44] PLAN: Building a wide-spectrum aesthetics dataset targeting 200-1000 images. Strategy:

HIGH-AESTHETICS targets:
- Golden hour landscapes, dramatic lighting (photos)
- Renaissance/classical masterpieces (artwork)
- Serene dreamlike beauty (dreamcore)
- Professional portrait photography (photos)
- Vibrant color harmonies in painting (artwork)

ANTI-AESTHETICS targets:
- Overexposure / blown-out highlights (photos)
- Motion blur / focus failure (photos)
- Urban decay: cracked concrete, rust, peeling paint (photos)
- Chaotic compositions, clashing colors (artwork)
- Unsettling surreal imagery, liminal spaces (dreamcore)
- Glitch art, digital artifacts (artwork/dreamcore)
- Dark/gloomy atmospheres (all datasets)
- Distorted proportions, grotesque figures (artwork)

WORKFLOW: Start with broad searches per dataset, then decompose into specific sub-elements, sample to calibrate thresholds, rate aesthetics, commit each sub-batch separately. Use negative prompts only for watermarks/text/empty frames. Cover all 3 datasets.
[2026-02-16 17:39:37] Broad search results:
1. PHOTOS "overexposed bright washed out": Top scores 0.38-0.44. Images show heavily overexposed scenes with blown-out highlights, motion blur, lens flare, abstract light streaks, and barely visible silhouettes. Very strong anti-aesthetic content. Distribution shows most images cluster at 0.06-0.17.
2. ARTWORK "dark gloomy chaotic": Top scores 0.54-0.59. Rich dark abstract expressionist paintings with heavy impasto, chaotic brushwork, somber palettes of black/brown/dark green/red. Strong anti-aesthetic art.
3. DREAMCORE returned "No Image Found" for preview but scores exist (0.43-0.45). Will retry with different query.

Next: Retry dreamcore, then begin systematic sub-element decomposition for photos dataset first.
[2026-02-16 17:39:52] Dreamcore search preview still shows "No Image Found" but scores exist (top: 0.53). Will try using sample() to view actual images from dreamcore dataset instead of search().

[2026-02-23 23:05:18] 【本次会话总结】"破败和陈旧"反美学数据集构建完成。新增5个子元素1. Rusted Metal(688c94ad:242、efbbd335:14)2. Cracked Concrete & Peeling Paint(79986ab1:282、25dde500:37、a6ee3cad:33)3. Weathered Wood(451b1d0a:281、72c75a38:12)4. Abandoned Buildings & Ruins(106fadd1:554、15c9b268:34、efa1dde4:24)5. Grime & Stains(200812ba:27)。本次新增合1,540张。总提交状82个，总图片34,044张。完成反美学宽谱定利当前目标。
[2026-02-24 20:58:27] 初始化完成。计划构建反美学数据集，覆盖9个核心概念：surrealism（超现实主义）、uncanny valley（恐怖谷）、plastic toy look（塑料玩具质感）、dreamcore（梦核）、weirdcore（怪核）、liminal space（阈限空间）、analog horror（模拟恐怖）、psychedelic art（迷幻艺术）、outsider/naive style（素人艺术）。将分解每个概念为具体视觉子元素，在photos/artwork/dreamcore三个数据集中搜索，目标>200张图像。先从surrealism和dreamcore开始探索。
[2026-02-24 20:59:33] 初始搜索返回四类优质结果：1) artwork中超现实主义画作（分数0.39-0.41），含滴落/扭曲人形的抽象表现；2) dreamcore数据集中的梦核室内（0.34-0.37），粉绿瓷砖泳池空间，朦胧怀旧；3) photos中恐怖谷人偶（0.43-0.50），蜡像般面部、多重复合人形、诡异表情；4) dreamcore中阈限空间（0.45-0.52），空旷走廊、 flooded rooms、无尽重复的几何结构。准备按子类别采样并提交。
[2026-02-24 21:01:43] 采样的5张图片：1) 青白色调的虚掩遮脸人像，手指缝隙中可见发光的眼睛，幽灵般半透明的质感；2) 绿光照射下的三面陶瓷人面雕塑，三面朝向不同方向；3) 蓝紫色调画面带水平扫描线干扰，模糊圆形面部轮廓带红色涂鸦痕迹；4) 半头部被白色泡沫覆盖的人物，绿色粗糙皮肤，戏剧化暗光；5) 近距离仰视的人脸，比例扭曲，眼窝深陷，底部硬光产生强烈阴影。全体呈现"近乎人类却非人"的恐怖谷特质。
[2026-02-24 21:03:50] Committed uncanny valley images from photos dataset (threshold 0.4). Sampled images showed: pale ghostly face with hand, double-faced ceramic head on pedestal, blurry abstract purple-pink shapes, green textured face with white substance, exaggerated puppet-like face with harsh shadows. Aesthetics scores ranged from -9.7 to 12.2, showing wide variance typical of anti-aesthetic content. Next: commit liminal spaces from dreamcore, then explore weirdcore and analog horror.
[2026-02-24 21:03:57] Committed liminal spaces from dreamcore and surrealism from artwork. Liminal spaces showed excellent empty transitional interiors. Surrealism batch had hazy ethereal artworks. Now exploring weirdcore fragmented identity, analog horror, and psychedelic art across datasets.
[2026-02-24 21:06:04] 搜索返回三类结果：1) photos中塑料玩具类（0.38-0.39分），包括粉色塑料娃娃（恐怖谷表情）、金属质感外星人玩偶、破碎玩具婴儿、微型乐高玩具；2) artwork中人造人形（0.41-0.37分），但更多是抽象表现主义扭曲人体绘画，而非塑料质感；3) dreamcore中weirdcore（0.35-0.28分），包含游戏拼贴、抽象3D形状、电视测试图、混合阈限空间的超现实场景。准备采样plastic toy和weirdcore两个批次提交。
[2026-02-24 21:07:19] Sampled weirdcore images show: CRT gaming setup surrounded by toys, abstract wooden curved sculptures, strange red blob creatures in suburban night, text meme about liminal spaces, surreal landscape with giant hand sculpture, liminal checkerboard hallway, doll in domestic interior, Bratz doll in dark forest with text overlay. Mix of digital collage, surreal imagery, and liminal aesthetics with varying quality.
