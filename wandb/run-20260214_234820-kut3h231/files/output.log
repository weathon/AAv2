[LOG] Initial broad search 'psychedelic art' on 'photos' completed. Observations: strong presence of neon swirls, oil-film / soap-film color patterns, kaleidoscopic mandala motifs, murals/tie-dye portraits, and some motion blur/long-exposure light trails. Next: decompose into specific visual subelements and run targeted searches per subelement across datasets (artwork, dreamcore, photos). Will sample each result range and run aesthetics_rate (DEBUG MODE).
